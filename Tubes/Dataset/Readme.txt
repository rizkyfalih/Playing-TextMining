Inflation, GDP derivatives seen on the way.

Companies may soon be able to trade derivatives of major economic indicators, such as inflation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as a hedge against business risks, a seminar was told on Monday.
Adrian Maconick, head of risk management at London-based Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group, said he saw demand from companies for derivatives products based on economic variables.
&quot;All sorts of things can be commoditised and, once they're a commodity, you can have a futures and an options exchange to manage the risk,&quot; he told a seminar on Financial Markets in 2000 at a two-day derivatives forum in Amsterdam.
Maconick said the technology used in exchange-traded options and futures businesses could be applied in a wider arena.
He could not predict when he believed derivative products based on economic indicators would be introduced but believed it was technically feasible to do it.
After the seminar, Maconick told Reuters he expected strong demand from companies for products that addressed business risk, which he saw as bigger for companies than financial risk.
He said companies could deal with many of these challenges internally, but they would also need specific derivatives to deal with specific risks.
&quot;The most obvious ones are the big economic variables -- things like GDP and inflation. There's no technical reason why these cannot become derivatives,&quot; he said.
&quot;At the moment, there isn't a clear market to handle it.&quot;
Business risks include changes in demand for a company's products while financial risks include movements in interest rates and currencies.
Maconick said firms could currently get tailor-made &quot;one-off&quot; products or use surrogates for these indicators, such as metal prices, which tended to move in line with economic activity, but these left a mismatch between risk and hedging.
