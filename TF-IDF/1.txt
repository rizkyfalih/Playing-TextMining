VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said late on Tuesday at a news conference to unveil the new Passat, slated for release in October, that VW has &quot;witnessed a slight pick-up; in the German market in the last few weeks.

He said the increase could stimulate German sales in the second half of 1996 and reaffirmed that VW expected full-year profits to top the 1995 level.

VW also said it wanted to double its 1995 third quarter group net profit of 72 million marks ($48.67 million) in 1996.

VW shares surged on the news, ending Frankfurt bourse trade up 14.50 marks at 551.50 marks, a gain of nearly three percent.
