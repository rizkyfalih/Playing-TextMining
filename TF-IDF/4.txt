Piech said VW, which owns luxury carmaker Audi AG, could envision offering a car for about 150,000 marks ($101,000) under the VW name that would cost about 200,000 marks at other carmakers.
Volkswagen is for the citizen what Mercedes is for the establishment, Piech said. But he added, We could push forward into higher price regions.

Piech said VW would not create a new brand such as Toyota did in creating Lexus but would instead expand on the Passat, which is designed like and built on the same platform as the popular Audi A4.
He dismissed criticism that the decision to use fewer production platforms led to fewer ways to distinguish between VW-made vehicles under the VW, Audi, Skoda and SEAT brands.
The differences will always be there but only when the customer also sees, hears and feels the vehicles, he said.
In the lower price range, Piech said VW was lining up its new Audi A3 compact, the VW Golf and the redesigned Beetle to compete against Mercedes' new A-class small vehicle.
Three against one, that should be sufficient, he said.
Piech also reaffirmed his support for controversial VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is at the centre of a legal fight between VW and General Motors Corp over allegations Lopez stole secret GM documents.
Lopez was GM's purchasing czar at its German-based Opel division when he defected to VW in March 1993. GM has filed a U.S. lawsuit against VW, which also names Piech. VW has denied GM's claims and filed its own suit charging GM with defamation.
Volkswagen is not involved in industrial espionage, Piech said in the interview. I am fully convinced of his personal character... One must meet him before passing judgment.
