VW chief wants to boost return on 

Volkswagen AG management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said in an interview on Sunday he intended to boost the German carmaker's meagre return on sales level more than tenfold by the turn of the century.
Piech said in the interview with Der Spiegel magazine that VW, Europe's largest carmaker, would keep up its cost-cutting measures and seek more favourable contracts from suppliers.
Piech, 56, said he viewed Chrysler Corp. as a model for Volkswagen since the U.S. carmaker had produced a similar number of vehicles -- about two million -- during the first six months of 1996.
He noted Chrysler had a return on sales of 6.6 percent compared to only 0.6 percent at VW during the 1996 first half.
Piech also said VW was about a quarter of the way on the road to reaching the goals he set out when he took over at the Wolfsburg-based carmaker in 1993.
When asked if VW could achieve its goal of a return on sales against pre-tax profits of at least 6.5 percent by 2000, Piech told the magazine, We have higher goals than just that. We want to become the most successful carmaker in Europe.
We always show this to our employees. Our return on sales is represented by a golf ball, Chrysler's by a big medicine ball, Piech said in the interview.
He also expressed confidence that VW's struggling Spanish subsidiary SEAT would return to profitability. But Piech was vague in saying how long embattled SEAT chairman Juan Llorens would remain with the carmaker.

If Mr. Llorens reaches retirement age, then he will be replaced with a competent manager, Piech said. He noted that the average retirement age for top VW managers was 55 to 65.
German publications have speculated that VW would not extend the contrct of Llorens when it expires in November, saying Piech was unhappy with the Seat restructuring.
Piech said VW's new version of the Passat saloon marked the start of VW moving into the higher-price range for luxury cars.
